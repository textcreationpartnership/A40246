            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Which may be seen in this short relation of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which was presented to the Parliament, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the consideration of all sober people, that they may see how these professors of <hi>New-England</hi> have lost their former tenderness, who fled from persecution, and now are become the chiefest of Persecutors.

               <p>ELeven strangers which are free-born English received 22. whipings, the stripes amounting to 350. Eleven inhabitants and free-born English re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 16. whippings, the stripes amounting to 160. Fourty five impris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onments of strangers and inhabitants, amounting to 307. weeks; two beaten with pitch ropea, the blows amounting to 139. by which one of them was brought near unto death; twenty five banishments upon penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties if returning, fines laid upon the inhabitants amounting to 318 pound eleven shillings; five kept fifteen dayes in all without food, and fifty eight dayes shut up close by the Goalor, and had none that he knew of; and from some of them he stopt up the windows, hindering them from convenient air; one laid neck and heels for sixteen hours; one very deeply burnt in the right hand with the letter H; one chained the most part of twenty days to a log in an open prison in the Winter; five appeals to <hi>England</hi> denied at <hi>Bosten;</hi> three their right ears cut by the Hangman; one of the inhabitants of <hi>Salem,</hi> had one half of his house and Land seized on, while he was in prison a moneth before he knew of it.</p>
               <p>These following sufferings among the <hi>Dutch,</hi> through the means of one <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Willet</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man, as it is said, in whom there hath been long an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable enmity against the power of godliness; one beaten with near an hundred blows, with a four inch pitch rope, in which time he fell down twice as one dead, and afterwards was tied up by the hands, &amp; a log tied to his feet and stript to the wast, and whipt with rods by a <hi>Negro</hi> with stripes without measure; his back, breasts, and arms bleeding, being much cut, and abundance of blood coming from them, and kept about eight weeks in prison, in a dirty miry dungeon, not fit to keep Swine in; three of the inhabitants of that Collony being English, were imprisoned in the Winter in dirty dungeons, and one of them fined fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>The causes of the forementioned sufferings are impartially laid down as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and commended to your serious consideration, that whereas the Lord God hath put power into your hands, you may make use of it to his praise and glory, in saving the innocent, and delivering the oppressed, and breaking the yoaks of the oppressor, and standing up in the power of God, to plead the cause of the persecuted people of God; so will the desires of the honest-hearted be to the Lord for you, that you may prosper in your undertakings, and that your eyes may be opened to see what is amiss.</p>
               <p>In the year 1656. two women named <hi>Mary Fisher,</hi> and <hi>Anne Austin,</hi> who were moved to go to <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> where they were imprisoned near
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47379:3"/> five weeks, and few or none suffered to come to them, and by order from the Governor and his assistants, their boxes were rifled, and what books was found in them was burnt (which books declared against sin and wickedness) by the hangman, and after sometime, upon suspicion without ground, of the womens being witches, they were stripped stark naked, and searched after such a manner, which modesty cannot particularly mention, but they were so dealt with that one of them who had been the mother of three children, said, she had not been so in the birth of her children, as she was by this inhumane searching, and after this without convincing them of any crime (besides threatening to whip them, they forced the Master of the ship to send them back to <hi>Barbados</hi> (according to their order) upon his own charge from whence he brought them.</p>
               <p>Soon after this there came to <hi>Boston</hi> in a <hi>London</hi> ship eight more of the people called Quakers, and after some slight examination of them, and neer eleven weeks imprisonment, wherein few were suffered to speak with them, except it were to ensnare them, and several abuses they suffered, as the taking away of their things; the Master that carried them was forced to bring them again to <hi>England,</hi> and was imprisoned four dayes, for not yeilding at first to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; so these eight also were violently sent away without any crime worthy of banishment laid to their charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicholas Vp shall</hi> an inhabitant in <hi>Boston,</hi> an ancient weak man of age sixty years, and of an honest report, for declaring against an oppressive law, and an act invented in their wills (before his door with the beating of a Drum) against them that are called Quakers, wherein they were called a cursed sect of hereticks and blasphemers, and great penalties laid upon any who should bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their jurisdiction, and that the Quakers should be put in prison and whipt, &amp;c.) was imprisoned and fined twenty pounds, and ordered to banishment in a months time, and not to return under pain of imprisonment, untill he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess his fault in declaring against their law, and before the time was out of his departure, they sent for him and sined him three pounds more for not coming to their worship, according to their law, five shillings for every first dayes absence from their meeting; so the old man went into <hi>Plimouth</hi> Pattent, which is the next Collony, determining there to stay that Winter, the which the Governor thereof (being an unreasonable man) sought by all means to hinder him, but thorow the moderation of some of the Magistrates, he was suffered to stay, but in the spring he was forced away, and this was in the Winter time which is so cold in those parts that it is dangerous to travel; the consideration of these things have made us to think, that pitty is wholly departed from them.</p>
               <p>In part of the year 1657. and 1658. these followings sufferings were sustained by some strangers who are called Quakers, who in obedience to the Lord went to <hi>New England,</hi> and also by some inhabitants in the same land who suffered for the exercise of a pure conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christopher Holder,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Copeland</hi> for going to an Iland called Martins Vineyard, had taken from them nine shillings three pence in mony by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors order, &amp; delivered unto some Indians to carry them off the Iland, among whom they found more kindness then among their own professing Country men, and afterwards for being taken in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Pattent, they were had before the Court, and sent away above fifty miles as vagabonds.</p>
               <p>Also <hi>Humphery Norton</hi> for being taken at <hi>Sandwitch</hi> on a first day, was carried to <hi>Plimouth</hi> by the Constable, and there kept prisoner several dayes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47379:3"/> sent away as a vagabond above fifty miles by the under Marshall; <hi>William Brend</hi> and <hi>Iohn Copeland,</hi> for not going out of <hi>Plimouth</hi> Collony in fourty eight hours, as required of the Magistrates, the weather not being seasonable for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, it being very wet and in the depth of Winter, were whipt with rods, <hi>Will. Brend</hi> received ten stripes, and <hi>Jo. Copeland</hi> twenty two stripes backward &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, drawing blood of back, breasts, and armes, and this cruelty did they on them without any law, saving their own wills, although the prisoners strongly pleaded <hi>Olivers</hi> Instrument of Government, which gives liberty to all profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing faith in Christ Jesus &amp;c. but that was not regarded by them, though they profess themselves to be under the Government of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Nuland</hi> and <hi>Ralph Allin</hi> inhabitant of <hi>Sandwitch</hi> in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for entertaining those who are called Quakers, and having meetings at their houses, and denying to swear, and refusing to give in security for the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, were fined twenty shillings a piece, for which was taken from <hi>William Nuland</hi> a Heifer better worth then thirty shillings, and their bodies imprisoned near five moneths in the depth of Winter near thirty miles from their wives and families, which were great, having many small children, which did prove much to their damage, and at their first moneth Court, in the year 1658. were cleared without any crime laid to their charge yet according to the Governors order were to pay five shillings for their commitment, and five shillings for their release<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and five shillings for every day of their imprisonment, the which they denied, yet did they satisfie the Marshal for their diet to his content.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Gaunt, Daniel Wing, Ralph Allin,</hi> and <hi>Will. Allin</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Sandwitch,</hi> were summoned to the Court held at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> in the first moneth 1658. under the pretence of fellony according to their law, for breaking into a mans house, where the man of the house cleared them, and the Governor told them there was a mistake in the sammons, yet for not putting off their hats, he fined them twenty shillings a piece, for which was taken from them to the value of five pounds, and at this Court they made a Law against friends, laying both fines and other sufferings upon both inhabitants and strangers, who should meet together for the worship of God contrary to their form; The sufferers under this Law follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humphery Norton</hi> and <hi>Iohn Rous</hi> for going to the Town of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> were apprehended and put in prison and had two examinations, wherein were many false charges laid against them, and <hi>Io. Rous</hi> did much plead with them for that liberty which free-born English men ought to have, yet of it was denied, and further to ensnare them, had an oath of the Magistrates own making tendered to them, the which they refusing, because they could not swear for conscience sake, the Governor called <hi>H.N.</hi> a Jesuite, and said he looked upon <hi>Io. Rous</hi> as Jesuated, and so caused <hi>Hum. Nerton</hi> to be whipt with twenty three stripes, and <hi>Iohn Rous</hi> with fifteen, and returned them to prison again for not giving them money.</p>
               <p>At this Court there was three of the inhabitants of <hi>Sandwitch</hi> put in the stocks for taking <hi>Iohn Rous</hi> by the hand, after he came from before the Court. On the seventh of the fourth moneth 1658. being the first day of the week, which they call their Sabbath, some friends were met together to wait upon the Lord at <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch,</hi> and by order from the Court, did the Constable come among them, and warn 14. of them to be at <hi>Plimouth</hi> by the next day at noon, which was twenty miles distant, the most of them that was summoned appeared at the time and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47379:4"/> place appointed, where they were fined five pound a piece, for refusing to take an oath which the Magistrates would impose on them without any order from the powers of <hi>England,</hi> and for refusing it, great havock was made of their estates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christopher Holder</hi> and <hi>Iohn Copeland,</hi> for being taken going to a meeting at <hi>Sandwitch,</hi> was kept by the Marshall prisoners several days, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with a threefold whip thirty three stripes, to the wounding of the hearts of several, so that a woman who was a stranger to them cryed out in the grief of her soul, and anguish of her spirit beholding the cruelty that then was acted) and said, How long Lord! how long will it be, ere thou avenge the blood of thine elect! and after bewailing her self, and lamenting her loss, said to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, Did I forsake father and mother, and all my dear relations, to come to <hi>New England</hi> for this? did I ever think that <hi>New England</hi> would come to this? Who would have thought it? We could desire that the same sensibleness did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the hearts of all to whom this doth come, and then would those who are in power here, make the condition of their suffering friends their own, and stand up in the power of God, and plead the cause of the oppressed, that so the warth of the wicked may be stopped, and the innocent may be delivered out of his power.</p>
               <p>Again sixteen of the inhabitants of <hi>Sandwitch</hi> were summoned to the Court held at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> in the eighth moneth 1658. and there were fined five pound a piece for not swearing, the which they could not do for conscience sake; in the gathering of these fines, with the others before mentioned, the violence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward Perry</hi> for not swearing, fined fifteen pounds, for which they took from him five Cows and two Heifers, worth twenty seven pounds, without shewing any Warrant for what was done by them that took them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Harper</hi> for not swearing, fined ten pounds, and had two young Oxen and two Heifers taken from him, worth thirteen pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ralph Allin</hi> for not swearing, fined ten pounds, and had cattle taken from him, marked for the Country, worth eleven pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Greenfeild</hi> for not swearing, fined ten pounds, and taken in cattle and other goods from him, eleven pounds in value.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>William Allin</hi> for the same, fined ten pounds, and two Cows and a Steer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for it, worth thirteen pounds, he was also fined five pound more on the same account, but of the taking of that, we have not yet an account.</p>

               <p>At the eighth moneth Court, because friends did not straight way go out of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47379:4"/> the Court, to the satisfying <hi>Thomas Princes</hi> hasty will, he cast three of them into prison, where they were kept several days in the cold weather from their families.</p>

               <p>Also for a small matter which they required of him for the Priest, in the spring time they took from him the Iron furni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Surely if the New Englands professors care was as great to pay what they owe unto all men, as they are to lay fines upon tender consciences, and to take from them more then their sines come to, their creditors both in old England and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, would have little cause to complain of them, but that spirit which leads to do justice in all things, is quite cast out from among them, both Church, Court, and Country, and that is the reason why so many have cause to complain of them in this particular.</p>
               <p>The particulars of these forementioned sufferings, were most of them given under the hands of the sufferers, who several of them are mean in the outward, and are by probability likely to be ruinated as to the outward (with their families, many of them having very many small children) if some course be not taken to prevent the course of these unmerciful men.</p>

Magistrates, who are violent persecutors of the good people in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Pattent, making a prey upon some, and keeping others in such fear, that they have much wronged their consciences; and that nothing might be wanting by them to trouble the honest people, they made one <hi>George Barloe</hi> one of their Marshals, extraordinary, finding him to be a man of a spirit fit for their purpose, who hath (before he was in place) been ready upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to joyn with the Constable to hunt the Lambs of Christ, and hinder their peaceable meeting together; and since he hath been in power, he hath made use of it to the utmost, to disturbe friends when they have been quietly met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wait upon the Lord, and when to avoid his troublesome spirit they have with-drawn into the woods, then hath it been his work to hunt after them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Sabbath a day of hunting, &amp; being forwarded in his wickedness by the Magistrates, he hath not ceased much to abuse friends; as once late in the night broke open a friends door at <hi>Sandwitch,</hi> and went into most of the rooms in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47379:5"/> house, under a pretence to search for Quakers, although there was none in the house at that time that he searched for; and the enmity in him is so high, that he said he would not leave them worth a groat; but he is a fit man for such a work, having formerly suffered the terrors of God for his uncleanness with an Indian as he said himself, but now his conscience is seared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humphrey Norton</hi> for coming into a Town called <hi>Southold</hi> in the evening on long Iland, intending in the will of God next day to pass away, was apprend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and carried to New Haven, and there kept the most part of twenty dayes and nights in an open prison in the Winter season, with his legg chained to a log of wood, in which time he was examined, and sentenced by <hi>Francis New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and his assistants (who are Magistrates for New Haven Collony) to be whipt, which was done with thirty six stripes, as the standers-by said; but had been more if a woman had not asked, whether they would kill him. 2.

               <p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47379:5"/> him to be whipt with thirty cruel stripes, the which was done within three hours after his coming thither, and continued him about twenty dayes in prison.</p>

                  <hi>Lawrence Southick</hi> and <hi>Cassandria</hi> his wise, and <hi>Iosiah</hi> their son, inhabitants of <hi>Salem,</hi> for saying that the Rulers and Priests, and laws were bloody, were taken from their families and occasions, and carried them to <hi>Boston,</hi> where they were whipt with ten stripes a piece, and kept prisoners several days in the twelfth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth 1657. and when they were let out, order was given that they should not stay above an hour in any house, under the penalty of their law, which is four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shillings an hour for any that conceal or entertain Quakers.</p>

                  <hi>William Maston</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>Hampton</hi> in <hi>Boston</hi> Collony, for having two small books which declared against sin in his house, was fined ten pounds, the which they took from him, and for their Priest, and for not going to their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they fined him eight pounds, and for visiting friends in prison, he was kept in prison two weeks, and threatned to be laid in Irons, and this was in very cold weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Shattuck</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>Boston,</hi> for not coming to their meeting at <hi>Boston,</hi> was whipt with ten stripes, and kept in prison several days, in the first moneth 1658. and afterwards banished from his wife and family, in which time <hi>Richard Bellingham</hi> Deputy-governor, used his utmost endeavor to set his wise and children against him, biding them disown him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Harris</hi> for going to the Steeple-house at <hi>Boston</hi> was put in prison, and whipt with ten stripes, and for not working for the Gaolor, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47379:6"/> had not a friend relieved him in the night season; and at another time had two and twenty blows laid on him with a pitch rope by the Gaolor.</p>
               <p>Sometime after <hi>Tho. Harris</hi> was committed to prison, <hi>William <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Gaolor having thus cruelly nigh murdered <hi>William Brend,</hi> great compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion arose in several of the inhabitatants of <hi>Boston,</hi> who in some measure mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to his necessities for the relief of the outward man, for which five of them were presented; so they will neither shew mercy themselves nor suffer others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Samuel Shattuck, Ioshua Buffum</hi> and <hi>Samuel Gaskin,</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Salem,</hi> for being taken at a meeting, where the two forementioned were, were sent to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to <hi>Boston,</hi> without any fair tryal or question asked them concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where they were whipt with ten stripes a piece, and kept neer a month from their families and occasions in the beginning of harvest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lawrence Southick</hi> and <hi>Cassandra</hi> his wife, and <hi>Iosiah</hi> their son, for being taken at the same meeting, were put in prison and there kept sixteen weeks, and <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandra</hi> whipt with ten stripes, all this time not suffering them at all to go to their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47379:6"/> families, although it was desired: in which time it being harvess, they lost the reaping of a Meddow, of which formerly they have had twenty load of hay in a year, for want of which their cattle was likely to perish in Winter: by the means of this their restraint, their estate is much run to ruin, and some fines were levied, and after all this they were let forth, not as Quakers; so here they have proved all their former sufferings to be without cause and illegal.</p>
               <p>Also at one of their Courts they put a daughter of the forementioned old peoples in the stocks, for telling the Magistrates when she was called before them, that they persecuted her father and mother.</p>

               <p>Also <hi>Nicolas Phelps</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>Salem,</hi> and a man of a very weak body, was carried from his house and family to <hi>Ipswitch</hi>-court in the time of harvest, and committed to the house of correction, where he was whipt three times in five days with ten stripes at a time, and after about fourteen days imprisonment, was released without the least crime laid to his charge, which might occasion such sufferings.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47379:7"/> and said in the face of the Court, You knave, I could find in my heart to knock you down; but for it he was not checked by them in the least; and after six days imprisonments more, the Marshals deputy, acompained with the hangman, and several hard hearted people came to the prison, where they were, and after they had barred the prison door fast, and let in none but whom they would, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any friends to the prisoners to come in, he read his Warrant to the prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which was to this effect, Commanding him to see the Executioner cut of the right ears of <hi>Iohn Copeland, Christopher Holder,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Rous</hi> Quakers, for the breach of the law titled Quakers; and charged them before as blasphemers, but could prove nothing against them, for when according to righteousness the prisoners have expected that the Magistrates should have brought their accusers face to face, and clearly in the sight of the people, convinced them of what they charged on them, which is but equal and just, in stead of this all along, they have entred into a dispute with them, it may be about the hat or some such thing, and when they have disputed with them so long as they have a minde, then what before they have prescribed in their mindes, they have sentenced the persecuted to suffer; and this hath been from time to time the manner of their proceedings against them who are called Quakers in New England; after he had read this Warrant, <hi>Io. Rous</hi> said, we have appealed to England; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal said, I have nothing to do with that, so the Warrant was executed upon the prisoners, by cutting their right ears; and after <hi>Christopher Holder</hi> and <hi>Iohn Copeland</hi> had been nine weeks in prison, and <hi>Iohn Rous</hi> six weeks, they were let out.</p>

               <head>These following Sufferings were sustained in the New Netherlands.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Hodgshon</hi> for being in a town called Hempsted under the Dutch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was apprehended and brought before one <hi>Gildersleeve,</hi> an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and called a Magistrate, who committed him to custody while he himself rode to the Dutch Governor, and brought the Fisgall and a guard of Musquetiers, who pinioned him, and after an inhuman manner tyed him to a Carts tail, and so brought him to New-Amsterdam, (with two women whom they took hold of for receiving him, the one had a childe then sucking) where <hi>Robert</hi> was cast into a dirty Dungeon; and after twice calling him before them, an Accusation was read unto him in Dutch, and all that was interpreted by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Willes</hi> their Interpreter, was this; It is the Generalls pleasure, seeing you have behaved your selfe thus, that you are to work two yeers at a Wheelbarrow with a Negto, or pay, or cause to be paid 600 Gilders; and for refusing to work, they caused a Negro to beat him with a pitch rope nigh four inches about, till he fell down twice as one dead: And feeing that they could not accomplish their ends thus, after some time keeping him in their dirty dungeon, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to have convenient food to sustain the outward man, he was carried into a private room, and there was tyed up by the hands, and a log of wood tyed to his feet, and stripped naked to his waste, and a strong Negro caused to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of stripes on him with rods both backwards and forwards, so that back, breast, and arms were grievously cut, and much blood run from him, and after a while they loosed him, after two dayes he was tyed again as before, and whipt; and after a while, he desired some time of consideration; and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of God what to do in this case, he had liberty to work; and after this an English-woman came to wash his stripes, who seeing him so low in body, told her husband she feared he would not live till the morrow; but after a few dayes, <hi>Robers</hi> was through the love of God restored to health again, and after a while through the means of the Governors sister, was set at liberty. It is thought by severall moderate people, that Captain <hi>Willet,</hi> an English-man, and one of Plymouth Magistrates, was the cause of these sufferings, by incensing the Dutch Governor with several false reports of them that are called <hi>Quakers;</hi> for a little
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47379:8"/> before this, <hi>Robert</hi> was with the Dutch-Governor, and the Governor was very moderate to him but since through misinformation, such a deadly enmity is grown up in him, that upon all occasions he doth seek to ruinate those that do receive or own the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and for this purpose hath made a Law, that those that receive any <hi>Quakers</hi> into their houses shall pay 50. l. the third part of which the Informer is to have, and to be concealed; and if any Vessel should bring a <hi>Quaker</hi> into their Jurisdiction, it should be forfeited with the goods. Great are the sufferings of the English under the Dutch in those parts, they waiting to make a prey upon them upon all occasions, especially the honest part, and we know that it would be a great joy of heart to many there, if the Powers of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland would take the Government of the English upon them, that so they might be eased of the yoke under which for some time they have served, they being liable to great fines and abuses upon every occasion which the Dutch will take. Two maids, named <hi>Mary Weatherhead,</hi> and <hi>Dororhy Waugh,</hi> for speaking in the street of New-Amsterdam, were cast into two Dungeons apart, which were so nasty, that several thought they could not live in them; and after eight dayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment were led through the street with rods tyed to their backs, to a boat that wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Tobias Feak</hi> and <hi>Edward Hars,</hi> because they could not prosecute the Dutch-Governors Order against the <hi>Quakers</hi> so called, were cast into prison, being Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Inhabitants of the town called Vlishing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry Townesend</hi> for receiving some friends into his house was fined 50 l. for not paying of which, he was cast into a miery Dungeon in the winter season, and for his releasment (his wise and friends searing his welfare in that nasty place, and the season being so cold) took a pair of young Oxen and a Horse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had no more, and gave them to the persecutors to free him out of prison.</p>

               <p>And friends, whereas there is and hath been a great talk of the conversion of the Indians in New-England, and many out of their desire to forward such a work, have largely given towards it, and a great shaw of a glorious conversion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them have severall of the New-England priests made, but it is for their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47379:8"/> own ends, they being fed with great sums of money, for which they must make a shew of something; but this can we testifie, having been often among them, That the greatest conversion that is wrought among them is, they are converted from their former simplicity, into subtilty, deceit, and hypocrisie: And what more can be expected, whilst they are under such a Ministery as is upheld by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and whose life and livelihood stands in these things before-mentioned? and as for the profession or talk of God which they have learned of the English it is but as a Tradition; for <hi>Iohn Rous</hi> being at a friends house in Sandwitch, where one of them who are called Christian Indians came: he being desirous to see if any thing of God was stirring among them, he asked the Indian where God dwelt? he pointed over his head, and said in heaven, as ignorant people use to answer: <hi>I. R.</hi> asked him how he knew? the Indian answered, He would tell him if he had his book, so he shewed wherein his knowledge of God stood. And at another time, <hi>I. R.</hi> met with another Indian at the same house, and asked him if hee were a Christian? he answered I: And whether hee knew Christ? He said I: So <hi>I R.</hi> asked him, If he ever saw Christ? The Indian said, No: So <hi>I.R.</hi> told him, if hee had not seen Christ hee did not know him; to which the Indian could not tell what to answer: Many instances of the like nature might be written, As when some of them have been asked, Who did tell them such a thing? They have answered, Mr. <hi>Ellios,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Maho,</hi> or some other, shewing that they knew no other Teacher to guide them or instruct them. And seeing &amp; knowing the deceit and badness of the New-England Priests, in causing people to believe that which is not true, through their boasting of high things, which never as yet were done by them, in faithfulness we write this for the laying open of all deceit, and for the information of the honest-hearted, that they may not be made a prey upon any longer by the Priests; for if they will preach among the Indians they should do it freely: And friends, wee do believe that if such a course as this were taken, that if that mony which is set apart for the converting of the Indians (as it is thought) were committed to the hands of such here as will be faithful in laying it out, upon such things as the Indians need, as cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. and that it be sent over to New-England, and there faithfully given forth amongst them as their need shall be; the English also themselves shewing forth a good life and conversation among them, more good by this means will be done to the converting of them, and far more glory will be brought to God, then hath as yet been through all the preaching of the Priests, for their talking doth but beget into a form, but this would beget into the power, and bring them to desire to know the God whom such serveth. And whereas some may say, If this be done, the Ministers will want encouragement to labor to convert them: Truly to such we answer, When the time of their converting to the power of God comes, those Ministers that will be imployed in that work, will not need encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from man; for if men doth not seek to hinder them, they shall not need to encourage them, for they will be such as dwell in the power of God, and by it are guided, the nature of which is to carry on those that are led by it, with all courage and valour to do that which they are called to, and their reward is with God; but the earthly spirit must have earthly encouragement, or it will faint; but that which is put into their mouths, is as water which is cast upon a dry barren howling wilderness which cannot be satisfied: therefore might it be more serviceable either to make use of it to a better use then at present it is, or let faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men be imployed in this business, that so the catterpillars and devourers may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47379:9"/> be famished. And truly with sadness may it be said, that more evil have, they learned from the English then good, for drunkenness and severall other things which are evill, were not among them before the English came into the Land, which since is increased, it is like, those who have part in this gain will rise up against us, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> did against <hi>Paul</hi> for fear of losing their gain; but we are wel satisfied, that when the hidden things of darkness shal be brought to light, that then abundance of deceit will be found in this design of seeming converting of the <hi>Indians;</hi> and if you desire a further testimony of the truth of this, we do believe that there are many in several parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> for the laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen of deceit, will give under their hands what further they know concerning this matter: And this is not written out of prejudice to any mans person, but in love to the simple that the deceitful spirit may be discovered, and truth may be made manifest to all, and all occasions of stumbling which may hinder any from coming to the knowledge of God and Christ Jesus the light, may be removed out of the way of all, whether Jew or Gentile, Turk or Indian; for there is a seed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them which must be gathered.</p>
               <p>And friends, having in short laid before you these sufferings which have been met with by the innocent in <hi>New-England,</hi> with the grounds and causes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth, which truly we should have said little of, were it not for the sake of those that may follow us, who may drink the same cup, and more bitter if the rage of the wicked be not stopt; for according to the Law at Boston, if a man come into their colony that saith thou to a single person, or keeps on his hat before one they call his Superior, or doth not acknowledge a Trinity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we read not of in Scripture, he is to be banished upon pain of death: And also for the sake of some inhabitants, whose sufferings have been great, and others who groan under the same yoke; this is the chief cause of the presenting this to your view: for what abuses we have suffered by them, all the world cannot make us amends for, being marked as rogues use to be; but being innocent, and hating all such actions as may justly deserve such marks, in true quietness we rest, being marked for the sheep of <hi>Christ,</hi> and bearing in our bodies the marks of the Lord Jesus: And having thus done, wee have discharged our consciences, and this will lie upon you, to arise in that power which the Lord God hath given you, and plead the cause of the oppressed, who hath no helper in the earth; and in this work the Lord God wil be with you, and wil (as he always hath when you have taken such works of mercy in hand) prosper you: And if in wisdom you should see it meete to take the Government of the four Vnited Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies into your hands, and give the honest and sincere-hearted free liberty of conscience, it would make many a glad heart in that land, and would bee as strength to the weak, and as the opening of the prison-doors to the captives, which would be a good day; and this if you come into the wisdom and power of God, you might easily do, by which all things should be governed, and so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the desires of many of the Inhabitants who much desire it, who groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the arbitrary power that the high-minded Rulers of New-England govern by, and also prevent the further shedding of innocent blood, and the spoiling of the innocent: And if this thing you do not seek to prevent, now you have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in your hands, and an opportunity to improve, it will lye heavy upon you, and be a stain to your posterity: but that you may bee preserved from such a weight and stain, and may use the power put into your hands, according to the will of God, without abusing it in the least, is the desire of us; who wait to see
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47379:9"/> the power of the Lord set up, and the kingdome of the man of sin spoyled and broken; for bearing witness against which, we have suffered the cutting off our ears from our unkind Countrymen in New-England, named, <hi>Iohn Copeland, Iohn Rous,</hi> and <hi>Humphrey Norton,</hi> who was burnt in the hand.</p>
               <p>If their agent here in <hi>England</hi> have any thing to say on their behalf, he may do well to appear.</p>
               <p>There doth a query arise whether they thus acting so contrary to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wholsome laws of the English Nation, and making so proudly laws according to their own wills, not in the least in them making mention of taking notice of the supream powers of <hi>England,</hi> have not forfeited their Pattent.</p>

What hunting up and down, and breaking up meetings, and disturbing the meetings of such as fears God, more like mad men then a people of a sober carriage! but as it written, persecution was ever blind, and so acted like hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink men, whose fury, malice, and heat, was not asswaged, untill <hi>Hum Norton</hi> you had burned in the hand: which shews you are a people more likely bred at <hi>Rome,</hi> who are so expert with your tortures, whips, scourges, pitch ropes, that you beat and whip and lash the servants of the Lord God withall, untill their bodys become like unto jelly, who are become unmerciful, cruel, hard-hearted, deadly in your persecution, fierce, rigorous in your madness; and now have got up a law to kill, put to death, banish such as say thou to you, and puts not off their hats, and goes under the name of Quakers, whose names in ages to come will stink and be recorded, whose madness, fury, bloodiness, cruelty, will stand upon record for ages, who stain your Nation with the blood of the innocent, and stains themselves with the blood of the servants of God, whose innocent blood lies dropping upon you, which nothing wil quench your rage but the blood of the innocent, and burning, and banishing, and spoiling of their goods, and making havock of them, and putting to death, taking away life; nothing will satisfie you devourers, it seems, but life; now you will have life, now you set up your law, which you call higher power which all must be subject to, which none must disobey your higher power, that is to kill, to banish, to whip, to burn, to cut off ears; and this is called a higher power set up in <hi>New England,</hi> which who disobeys it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47379:10"/> disobeys the higher power; and this is the profession (to whip with pitcht ropes) of Magistrates and Christians and their teachers, burn, kill, banish, break up meetings of them that fears God, spoil their goods, fine them, whose cruelty hath stained them with the blood of the Saints, and corrupted the land with innocent blood, which it will be hard for ever to be repaired again, the breach which they have made betwixt themselves and God, which hath thrown away his doctrine and command, which is to love enemies, and entertain strangers: not to burn enemies, not to whip them with pitch ropes, not to cut off their ears, banish them and spoil their goods, not to burn them in their hands, Christ taught not to break up their meetings with armed men, not to spoile and take their goods from them, but to feed enemies, and love enemies; now your love is seen who are men of New England, quite contrary to the love of Christ and the command of Christ, and doctrine of the Apostles, in this entertaining of strangers, and so have shewed your selves to be the bastard Christians, such as have got the name, but are dead from the life and power; was there ever such a nest and company of mad men gathered together, that nothing will satisfie them but the ears, burning in the hand, and prisoning, fining, plundring, straining the goods of people, whipping with pitch ropes; Is this New Englands spiritual weapons that they fight withall? have they no better weapons to fight for Christs kingdom? doth not this manifest to be the weapons of the devil, Satan, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one, and such as fight with flesh, and not with the powers of darkness, for they that do so, must fight with spiritual weapons; are not you become a stink to all the heathens and Indians about you? onely be recorded amongst the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and bloody persecuters; Oh bloody New England, whom nothing will satisfie but blood and life! Oh banishing New England, spoilers of the goods of people. Oh New England is this thy work, to cut off ears, whip with pitch ropes? hast thou not stained thy glory for ever, mar'd thy profession, and made thy Religion to stink before God and men, and made thy self an abomination to all that seeks God, and made your selves manifest who are brought now to the light, that all your profession hath been but from your own rotten, corrupt, hard hearts, and not from the sincerity of the Lord; how many hath bled among you? how are you besprinkled with the blood of the innocent of the Lord? how have ye mar'd and dismembred the creatures of God? which had you been in his wisdom, you would have loved them and received them, though they had been enemies, and sought to have brought the creature into the liberty of the sons of God; how has your mad, earthly, devilish, sensual wisdom appeared, and the fruits of it declared it self, not to be the wisdom which is from above, which is gentle, meek, and easily to be entreated, and pure, and peaceable; Oh how is many thousands in old England grieved to see that thus you are fallen into the earth, and into the dark power and acted with it, and fled from the sincerity which some of you had formerly. Oh how is your maiden head gone, and you lost from the virgins state, that you are become vain and more brutish then any men. Oh who would have looked for such fruits from New England, who themselves were once under suffering and banishment? Oh who would have looked and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that your latter end should have been worse then the beginning, who are gone now with the dog, biting and worying, and vomiting out the filthiness, which some of it we have seen in Old England here.

Oh! who would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or have looked, that you in New England, who was banished for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47379:10"/> sake, should now become as briars and thornes, and a wilderness, and weeds, whose heart hath the possession of the earth and not the Lord?

Oh misetable! the lamentation is over you all; Oh who would have believed that such a thirst would have risen among you, that nothing will quench but the blood of the innocent, and the blood of them that keep the command of Christ, and walks in the doctrine of the Apostles! was there ever the like heard of in the Scripture or New Testament as your selves? with whom will you paralel your selves? Oh! I am grieved that you or any one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth should profess Scriptures, and bring such a stain upon your selves, and such a dishonor upon the truth, and cause the name of Christ and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the Apostles, to be thus blasphemed by the vulgar sort, and set at nought through such a wretched company as you; but the hand of the Lord is turned against you and gone over you, and his mighty power is stretched over you that you cannot hide your selves nor be hid, but the Lord God of power by his power will bring all your actions to light, and his power and arme you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape; and you had been better a milstone had been hanged about your necks then you had offended the little ones; and if they go into everlasting puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment that are the goats that visit not Christ in prison, what will become of you, and whether will ye go, that cut off the ears, and prisons, and burns, and banishes, and whips with pitch ropes till you make their bodies like jellies; now this is your fruits (who hath had long the sheeps cloathing) which is the mark of Goats, the mark of Wolves, the mark of Antichrist, and the false Prophets, which are not to be followed, for the power of the Lord God lets see over you, and gives victory and dominion; and I believe them that be in the power of God, will not fear you tortures, will not fear your pitch ropes, who use to beat them till you make their bodies like Jellies, and not fear your cutting of ears, nor burning in the hand, and your murdering and putting to death for wearing their hats, and saying, <hi>Thou</hi> to a particular person, and trembling at the word of God, and working out their salvation with fear and trembling; if such meet in our Pattents and Jurisdictions, burn them in the hand, cut off their ears, fine them, prison them, banish them, whip them with pitch ropes; Is not this New Englands Government at the heighth of their rage, and they with the devil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pinacle doing his work, and call that the higher power, to which people must be subject to, with which they act these things to maintain and uphold their Church-Ministry, and Christianity which is far below the power of God, and the power of God is far above it, which will overthrow that power and the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors both.</p>

               <p>Besides the forementioned sufferings inflicted on the bodies and estates of such as fear the Lord, and worship him in spirit, and therefore withdrew from the dead sacrifices of the Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> the Rulers find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their former Laws and Acts did not effect that which they intended, namely, the thorow rooting out the power of godliness, and them that dwell in it, they proceeded to make another Law, which was (after much railing, and casting as many odious terms on them that are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as they could rake up) <hi>That if any of them were found in their jurisdiction that were not inhabitants, they should be banished upon pain of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In prosecution of this their Order as their <hi>May</hi> Court, 1659. they banished one <hi>Will. Brend</hi> to be gone in 48. hours, and if he was found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time, he was to be apprehended and cast in prison, and proceeded with according to their Law, which is <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at the same Court for the offences pretended against some of the Inhabitants, for which they had from time to time suffered long imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cruel whippings, and scourgings, and the spoiling of their goods to a great value, the Rulers took hold on six of them, and banished them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of death, two of which were very aged people, who through tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels by sea unfit for their years, and sufferings, and other inconvemences which came upon them in their banished state, have ended their dayes, whose death we can do no less then put upon the account of their persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they being the occasion of it. Since which they have imprisoned five more, three men and a woman, whom they cast in prison with her clothes wet, and a childe between ten and eleven years of age, who was moved of the Lord to go from her outward being, 105. miles to <hi>Boston,</hi> where she was cast into prison, and being enamined, her answers were so far beyond the ordinary capacity of a child of her years, that the Governor confessed there was a spirit in her beyond the spirit of a woman; but being blind, and not seeing God perfecting his praise out of the childs mouth, said, It was the Devil: These five were in prison to be banished on pain of death; their Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timusses follow, which will further shew the spirits of them that write them; and from what spirit they take advice, whose ways are so contrary to God, and those that follow him.</p>

                  <p>MY Respects presented to you and Mrs. <hi>Brown,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and desiring your present and eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the state and condition of things amongst us, it is sad, and like so to continue; the Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an persecuting spirit is very active, and that in the powers of this World; he that will not whip and slash, banish and persecute men that differ in matters of Religion, must not fit on the Bench, nor sustain any office in Commonwealth; Last election Mr. <hi>Hatherly</hi> and my self left off the Bench, and my self discharged of my Captain-ship, because I had entertained some of the <hi>Quakers</hi> at my House (thereby that I might the better be acquainted with their principles;) I thought better so to do, then with the blind World to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, condemn, rail, and revile them when they never saw their persons, nor knew any of their principles: But the <hi>Quakers</hi> and myself cannot close in divers things, and so I signified to the Court I was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> but must bear my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony against sundry things that they held, as I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and opportunity; but with all I told them, That as I was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> so I would be no Persecutor: This spirit did work those two years that I was of the Magistracy, during which time I was on sundry occasions forced to declare my discent in sundry actings of that nature, which although done with all moderation of expression, together with due respect unto the rest, yet it wrought great dis-affection and prejudice in them against me, so that if I should say some of themselves set others on work to frame a Petition against
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47379:12"/> me, that so they might have a seeming ground from others (though first moved and acted by themselves) to lay me what they could under reproach) I should do no wrong, the Petition was with nineteen hands, it wil be too long to make rehearsal of; it wrought such a disturbance in our Town, and in our Military company, that when the Act of Court was read in the Head of the Company, had not I been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and made a speech to them, I fear there had been such actings as would have been of a sad consequence. The court was again followed with another Petition of 54. hands, that I might be restored to them, or some satisfactory Reasons wherefore I might not: The court return the Petitioners an answer with much plausibleness of speech, carrying with it great shew of respect to them, readily acknowledging with the Petitioners, my parts and gifts, and how useful I had been in my Place, professing they had nothing at all against me, but onely in that thing of giving entertainment to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when as I broke no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">

Another, <hi>That if any see a</hi> quaker, <hi>he is bound if he lives six miles or more from the Constable, yet he must presently go and give notice to the Constable, or else is subject to the censure of Court,</hi> (which may be, <hi>Hang him.</hi>) Another; <hi>That if the Constable know or hear of any</hi> quaker <hi>in his Precincts, he is presently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, and if he will not presently depart the Town, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable is towhip them, and so send them away;</hi> and divers have been whipt with us in our Patent; and truly to tell you plainly that the whipping of them with such cruelty as some have been whipt, and their patience under it, hath sometimes been the occasion of gaining more adherence to them, then if they had suffered them openly to have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a Sermon: Also another Law, <hi>That if there be a</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>meeting any where in this Collony, the party in whose house, or on whose ground, is to pay</hi> 40. s. <hi>the Preaching-quaker</hi> 40. s. <hi>every

Our last Law, That now they are to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and carryed before a Magistrate, and by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be kept close prisoner until he will promise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and never come again, and will also pay his fees, which I perceive they will do neither the one nor other; and they must be kept onely with the Countreys allowance, which is but small, (namely, course bread and water) no friend may bring them any thing, none may be permitted to speak to them; nay, if they have money of their own, they may not make use of that to relieve, themselves. In the <hi>Masatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets</hi> (namely <hi>Boston</hi> Collony) after they have whipt them, cut their ears, have now at last gone the furthest step they can, they banish them upon pain of death if ever they come there again; We expect that we must do the like, we must dance after their Pipe; Now <hi>Plymouth</hi>-Saddle is upon the Bay-Horse, (to wit, <hi>Boston</hi>) we shall follow them on the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, for it is well if in some there be not a desire to be their apes and imitators in all their proceedings in things of this nature; all these carnal and antichristian wayes being not of Gods appointment, effect nothing as to the obstructing or hindering them in their way or course, it is onely the Word and Spirit of the Lord that is able to convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers; they are the mighty Weapons of a christians War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, by which great and mighty things are done and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished: They have many Meetings, and many adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, almost the whole town of <hi>Sandwitch</hi> is adhering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; and give me leave a little to acquaint you with their sufferings, which is grievous unto, and sads the hearts of most of the precious Saints of God, it lyes down with them, and rises up with them, and they cannot put it out of their minds, to see and hear of poor Families deprived of their comforts, and they brought into penury and want, (you may say, by what means? and to what end?) as far as I am able to iudge of the end, it is to force them from their homes and lawful habitations, and to drive them out of our coasts; <hi>Masathusats</hi> have banished six of their own Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47379:13"/> to be gone on pain of death, and I wish that blood be not shed; but our poor people are pillaged, and plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their goods, and happily when they have no more to satisfie this unsatiable desire, at last may be forced to fly, and glad they have their lives for a prey: As for the means by which they are so impoverished, these in the first place were scupulous of an Oath, why then, we must put in force an old Law, that all must take the Oath of fidelity, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tendred, they will not take it, and then we must ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>When the time is come they are the same as they were, then goes out the Marshal, and fetches away their Cows, and other Cattle. Well, another Court comes, they are required to take the Oath again, they cannot, then 5 l. more, on this account 35 head of Cattle, as I am credibly informed, has been by the authority of our Court taken from them the latter part of this Summer; and these people say, if they have more right to them then themselves, let them take them, some that had a Cow onely, some two Cows, some three Cowes, and many small Children in their Families, to whom in Summer time, a Cow or two was the greatest outward comfort they had for their Subsistence. A poor Weaver that has seven small children, or eight, I know not which, he himself lame in his body, had but two cows, and both taken from him, the Marshall asked him what he would do, he must have his Cows, the man said, that God that gave him them, he doubted not, but would still provide for him To sill up the measure yet more full, though to the further emptying of <hi>Sandwitch</hi> men of their outward comforts, the last Court of assistants, the first <hi>Tuesday</hi> of this instant the Court was pleased to determine fines on <hi>Sandwitch</hi> men for meetings, sometimes on first dayes of the week, sometimes on other dayes, as they say, they meet ordinarily twice in the week besides the Lords day, 150 l. whereof <hi>William Nuland</hi> is 24 l. for he and his wife, at 10 s. a meeting, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Allen</hi> 46. l. some affirm it 49 l. the poor Weaver before spoken of 20 l. Brother <hi>Cook</hi> told me, one of the Brethren
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47379:14"/> at <hi>Bastable</hi> certifled him that he was in the Weavers house when (cruel <hi>Barlow) Sandwitch</hi> Marshal came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the summe, and he said that he was fully enformed of all the poor man had, and thought if all laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether it was not worth 10 l. what will be the end of such courses and practices, the Lord onely knows, I heartily and earnestly pray, that these and such like courses neither raise up amongst us, nor bring in upon us, either the sword or any devouring calamity, as a just avenger of the Lords quarrel for Acts of injustice and oppression, and that we may every one find out the plague of his own heart, and put away the evil of his own doings, &amp; meet the Lord by entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of peace, before it be too late, and there be no remedy.</p>
                  <p>Our Civil Powers are so exercised in things appertaining to the Kingdome of Christ in matters of Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that we can have no time to effect any thing, that tends to the promotion of the Civil Weal or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of the place, but now we must have a State Religion, such as the powers of the world will allow (and no other) a State-Minister, and a State way of maintenance, and we must worship and serve the Lord Jesus, as the world shall appoint us, we must all go to the publick place of meeting in the Parish where he dwells, or be presented, I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of three or fourscore last Court presented, for not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to publick meetings, and let me tell you how they brought this about, you may remember a Law once made, called <hi>Thomas Hinkleys</hi> Law, that if any neglected the worship of God in the place where he lives, and set up a worship contrary to God, and the allowance of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the publick prophanation of Gods holy day, and Ordinance shall pay 10 s. this Law would not reach, what then was aimed at because he must do so and so, that is, all things there expressed, or else break not the Law in <hi>March</hi> last a court of Deputies was called, and some Acts touching Quakers were made; and then they contrived to make this Law to be serviceable to them, and that was by putting out the word (and) and put in the word (or) which is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, and makes every branch to become a Law, so now if any do neglect, or will not come to the publick Meetings,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47379:14"/> 10. s. for every defect, certainly, we either have less wit, or more money then the <hi>Massathusets,</hi> for, for 5 s. a day a man may stay away till it come to 12. or 13 l. if he had it but to pay them: and these men altering this Law now in <hi>March,</hi> yet left it dated <hi>June</hi> the 6th 1651. and so it stands as the Act of a General court, they to be the Authors of it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years before it was in being, and so you your self have your part and share in it, if the Recorder lie not, but what may be the reason that they should not by another Law made and dated that court, as well effect what was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as by altering a word, (and so the whole sence) of the Law, and leave this their Act by the date of it charged on another courts account; surely the chief instruments in the businesse, being privy to the Act of Parliament for liberty should too openly have acted repugnant to a Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but if they can do the thing, and leave it on a court as making it six years before the Act of Parliament, there can be no danger in this, and that they were privy to the Act of Parliament for liberty to be then in being, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Deputies might be free to act it, they told us that now the Protector stood not engaged to the articles for liberty; for the Parliament had now taken the power into to their own hands, and had given the Protector a new Oath, onely in general to maintain the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so produced the oath in a Paper in writing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Act of Parliament, and the Oath are both in one book in Print, so that they that were privy to the one, could not be ignorant of the other, but still all is well, if we can but keep the people ignorant of their liberties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, then we have liberty to act in our own wills what we please, we are wrapped up in a Labyrinth of confused Laws, that the free mens power is quite gone, and it was said last <hi>June</hi> Court by one, that they knew nothing the freemen had there to do; <hi>Sandwitch</hi> men may not go to the Bay, least they be taken up for Quakers, <hi>William Nuland</hi> was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his occasions some ten dayes since, and they put him in prison 24 hours, and sent for divers to witness against him, but they had not proof enough to make him a Quaker, which if he had he should have been whipt, nay they may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47379:15"/> not go about their own occasions in other Towns in our Colony, but warrants lie in ambush to apprehend them, and bring them before a Magistrate to give an account of their businesse. Some of the Quakers from <hi>Road</hi> Island came to bring them goods to trade with them, and that for far rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonabler terms, then the professing, oppressing Merchants of the Country, but that will not be suffered, that unlesse the Lord step in to their help and assistance in some way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mans conceiving, their case is sad and to be pitied and truly, it moves bowels of compassion from all sorts except those in place, who carry with a high hand toward them, through mercy we have as yet amongst us worthy Mr. <hi>Dunster,</hi> whom the Lord has made boldly to bear testimony against the Spirit of persecution: Our Bench now is <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Prince,</hi> Governour, Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> Captain <hi>Willet,</hi> Captain <hi>Winslow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alden,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Southworth, William Bradford Thomas Hinkly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> last <hi>June</hi> would not sit on the Bench if I sat there, and now will not fit the next year, unlesse he may have 30 l. fit by him: our Court and Deputies last <hi>June</hi> made Captain <hi>Winslow</hi> a Major, surely we are all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Souldiers, that must have a Major imposed on us, Doubtlesse the next Court they may choose us a Governor, and Assistants also, a free man shall need to do nothing, but bear such burdens as shall be laid upon him; Mr. <hi>Alden</hi> has deceived the expectation of many, and indeed lost the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of such as I judge were his cordiall Christian friends, who is very active in such wayes, as I pray God may not be charged on him, to be oppressions of a high nature.</p>
